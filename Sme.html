              Having worked in the Diagnostics industry for over 30 years, I am
              fortunate to have many colleagues and friends who are Subject
              Matter Experts in various related fields such as Quality,
              Regulatory, Manufacturing and Commercialization. Some of these
              colleagues are either independent consultants or work in academia
              and other institutions where 3rd party consultancy can be provided
              confidentially and without a conflict of interest.
